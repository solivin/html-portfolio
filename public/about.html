<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, my name is Nathan. I am a web developer that also works in the U.S. Army. I started learning how to develope web pages 
  to fill my time on deployment in 2020. After I started learning HTML I found something that I enjoyed about it, and wanted to 
  keep working on the skill.

  Going back a little bit from where I am now, I was always interested in technology. My father got me into working on computers
  and developing my skills with the physical side of the tech industry. Seeing as I am a gamer, I started wanting to develope my 
  own game. However, I never started learning that skill (I still have plans to learn game dev at some point). I graduated highschool
  in 2019 and shortly after left for basic training. After basic training and AIT (advanced individual training) to become a 25B,
  information technology specialist, I got to my first unit and deployed in 2020.
